## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: This project relies on Meson. If you don't have Meson installed, visit the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) for installation instructions.

## Setting up, Compiling, Installing, and Running the Project

**Adding Dependency**:

Create a directory named subprojects in the root directory, next create a file named `fscl-xutil-c.wrap` in the `subprojects` directory of your project with the following content:

   ```ini
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossil-lib/fscl-xutil-c.git
   revision = main
   
   [provide]
   fscl-xutil-c = fscl_xutil_c_dep
   ```

**Integrate Dependency**:
   ```meson
   project('my_project', 'c')

   exe = executable('my_project', 'my_project.c',
       dependencies : dependency('fscl-xutil-c')) # add this line

   test('basic', exe)
   ```

## Including the Demo and Running Tests

To run tests, you can use the following options when configuring the build:

- **Running Tests**: Add `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

Example:

```zsh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```
